CREATE is in the process of building its own UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle). This will be used as a platform for our members to develop and test autonomous robotic systems without needing a degree in Mechatronics Engineering.

Affectionately nicknamed "Deborah" or "Debbie", the UGV feature motors collected from a second-hand electric wheelchair, a custom-designed and welded steel chassis and a 2D LiDAR.

"Debbie" currently have the capability to drive autonomously in short distances via the use of a GPS guidance system, avoid obstacles in both autonomous and controller mode, and carry a load of 70kg maximum.

Our current aim is to get the robotic vehicle to navigate itself from lower campus at UNSW Kensington (Anzac Parade) all the way up to the top of campus on Botany St. Not an insignificant distance! As part of this challenge, it will need to navigate itself through wheelchair access routes. We also hope to do various modifications on the platform to enter competitions in the near future.

This project is open to participation from anyone.
