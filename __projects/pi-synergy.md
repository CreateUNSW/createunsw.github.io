** Circular Quay, NSW - Friday 25 May 2018 ** - CREATE NSW Inc., a student-run club at the University of New South Wales, presents [Synergy](https://www.vividsydney.com/event/light/synergy), its 2018 entry for the Vivid Festival. This project marks our first collaboration with MAKE CLUB (est. 2016) CREATE's sister club from university’s Art & Design campus. In addition, the existing Vivid Team within CREATE has been officially branded Project Illuminate. This has been done to mark the welcome introduction of skilled designers into our team, our long-term commitment to the Vivid Sydney program, and this team’s unique specialisation in interactive artworks. 

Synergy, which marks CREATE’s fifth year of involvement with the Vivid Sydney festival, presents a pretty tableau from nature - a large plywood tree surrounded by ferns. This deceptively simple scene however, represents the interlinked mechanisms of a superorganism. In these complex beings, inconspicuous organisms demonstrate emergent properties by sharing signals and nutrients for the greater good of the collective. In Synergy, this survival mechanism is demonstrated by the  illumination of the ferns which are triggered by the passage of visitors along the path. 

The Project Illuminate Team for 2018 is led by Jonathan Hribar, with project management and support from Junji Moey and MAKE CLUB President Tsz Kin William Liu. The team consists upwards of 40 people who participate in artistic design, engineering design, operations, marketing, construction and maintenance. 

For aspiring engineers and designers, this project provides provision of practical skills in project management, design and fabrication skills, client relations, collaboration and communication. It represents an experience-rich opportunity for the maker community to sink their teeth into and supplement their university studies. Synergy also marks CREATE’s most ambitious project to date, a feat which would not have been possible without the combination of all the member’s skills and experiences. 

Synergy will be exhibited daily from 6pm to 11pm from 25th May 2018 to 16 June 2018 at Jessie Street Gardens in Circular Quay. You can find more details about our artwork [here](https://www.vividsydney.com/event/light/synergy).

## About CREATE
CREATE (Est. 2012) is a student-run club at the University of NSW that runs and supports practical projects for students to learn skills in engineering, invention, design and collaborate on those projects. We run and provide workshops for beginners on electronics, programming, soldering, prototyping and 3D modelling, and selling electronic components on campus.
Projects run by our club include UAV development, machine vision workshops for autonomous cars and various personal “gadgets”. CREATE was involved in the Outback UAV Challenge and QUT Droid Racing Competition (we came first place in DRC 2016!).
Most of our members are engineering, built environment and art and design students from a wide range of disciplines, including mechanical, mechatronic, electrical, civil engineering, computer science, architecture, industrial design and fine arts. However, the club is open to students from all faculties and our workshops also cater to members of the wider community.

## About MAKE CLUB (UNSW Art & Design)
MAKE Club (Est. 2016) is a student-run initiative and the very first constituent club at UNSW Art and Design guided by the belief that anyone can be a maker. We hold workshops, consultations and facilitate collaborations so students can bring into realisation any fun or professional projects they may have in their minds.
MAKE CLUB is a sister club of CREATE UNSW.
