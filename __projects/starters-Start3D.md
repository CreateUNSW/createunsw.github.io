We are building 1 METER CUBED 3D printer. The printer will feature a huge build volume, high accuracy printing as well as carbon fiber, nylon, polycarbonate, composite and metal filament printing capabilities. This is an exciting project and a great starting point for anyone new to CREATE.

We are currently in the process of establishing team roles and structure. We meet every Monday evening at the MCIC.
