VP of Events - 2018
Co-Director of Sales - 2017

I started off as a member and volunteer with Create from the early parts of 2016, helping out at our weekly sales stall and workshops. I appreciated the desire of Create's vision in generating a community incorporating the maker movement and engineering ideals, and wished to be more involved in its activity. I saw the position of Sales Director as a gateway to contribution with my experience with Create's activities.
