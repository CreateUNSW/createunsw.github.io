2018 - President
2017 - Secretary

Daniel Li began working with CREATE at the start of 2016, beginning as a Sales Helper, but furthering his role within the club as one of the helpers working on the Events Subcommittee. Aiding in club social events such as Barbecues and weekly makerspaces as well as external events such as Sydney Mini Maker Faire, his contributions have helped him gain the skills and contacts needed for the role of Secretary in 2017. Continuing his work within CREATE, Daniel took upon the role as the main workshop presenter and has subsequently been elected the 2018 President.
